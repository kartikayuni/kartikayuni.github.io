                    I’m Yuni, a teacher of Indonesian language, and I invite you to learn Bahasa Indonesia online with me. I offer individual Bahasa Indonesia classes over Skype. As a teacher I see my goal to make you speak Bahasa Indonesia within the shortest time possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Bahasa Indonesia: why is learning worth the effort,
                    even if just for a vacation?
                </h2>
                <p>
Indonesia is a vast and incredibly diverse country. I’ll use Halmahera island (it’s in North Maluku) to give you a brief example. In Halmahera, you can climb Mount Ibu and watch mini-eruptions occurring every  20 minutes from a safe distance of about 200 meters; you can visit the semi-nomadic  Togutil people who still run in jungle barefoot, hunting wild pigs with a spare; or watch a walking shark, if you are into diving - and this is just a single island. By the way, there are about 17000 islands in Indonesia.
                </p>
                <p>
Best of all, the Indonesians are warm, very welcoming people, particularly in the countryside. But here is a catch - as soon as you get away from excessively touristic areas like Bali, you will meet very few people who speak English. So, be it walking sharks or flying snakes, Bahasa Indonesia will certainly be an asset.

While learning a foreign language is always an effort, Indonesian language is relatively simple: we use the very same Latin alphabet you use in English, we have just four verb tenses, and incredibly simple pronunciation rules.

                </p>
                <p>
By the way, you do already know a couple of Indonesian words at least. You know how to say “man” and “forest”! Sure, the word “orangutan” comes familiar, right? Well, “orang” means “man”, and “hutan” means “forest”. So, the learning has indeed already started. Book a lesson, and we shall get you prepared for the adventure!
